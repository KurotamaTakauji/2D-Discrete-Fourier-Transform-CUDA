Implementation of the 2D Discrete Fourier transform using CUDA.

This program computes the forward and reverse Fourier transform of the given input 2D matrix.

Assumption: All input files will be square, same width and height and will be a power of 2

Execution-

Forward DFT
./p33 forward [INPUTFILE] [OUTPUTFILE]
Reverse DFT
./p31 reverse [INPUTFILE] [OUTPUTFILE]

EXAMPLE-

Forward DFT
./p33 forward Tower256.txt Output256.txt
Reverse DFT
./p31 reverse Tower256.txt Output256.txt
